A simple ATM simulation in C++ . The program asks the user for a PIN, then provides a menu to check balance, deposit, withdraw, or exit. It is built with basic functions, loops, conditions, and simple input/output to practice modular programming and problem solving.

# Simple ATM System  

## üìå Description  
A simple ATM simulation in C++ without OOP or file handling. The program asks the user to enter a correct PIN, then provides a menu to check balance, deposit, withdraw, or exit. It is built with basic functions, loops, conditions, and simple input/output to practice modular programming.  

---

## üéØ Objectives  
- Practice dividing the program into small functions.  
- Use control structures (`if`, `switch`, `do..while`).  
- Handle user input with `cin` and `cout`.  
- Simulate a real-world system using only C++ basics.
